## Xiaomi Mi M365 Review

The Xiaomi Mi M365 is a well-rounded electric scooter with an impressive range of 18.6 miles. Its sturdy aluminum frame and 8.5-inch pneumatic tires provide a smooth ride, while the max speed of 15.5 mph is adequate for most urban commutes.

**Pros:** 
- Long-range
- Durable build quality
- Regenerative and disc braking

**Cons:** 
- No suspension
- Longer charging time

The M365â€™s regenerative and disc braking system allows for efficient stops, adding to user safety. However, the lack of suspension may result in a less comfortable ride on rough surfaces. Priced between $400 and $500, it offers excellent value for its features and build quality.

## Segway Ninebot ES2 Review

The Segway Ninebot ES2 offers a similar max speed to the M365 but falls slightly short in range. However, it makes up for this with its innovative shock absorption system and customizable LED lights, which enhance both comfort and visibility.

**Pros:** 
- Shock absorption system
- Customizable LED lights
- Lightweight and foldable

**Cons:** 
- Shorter range compared to Xiaomi M365
- Less efficient braking system

Priced between $500 and $600, the ES2 is slightly more expensive than the M365. However, its additional features may justify the higher price point for some users.

## Razor E Prime III Review

At a slightly lower price range of $300 to $400, the Razor E Prime III delivers a punch with a max speed of 18 mph. Although it has the shortest range of the three, it's the lightest scooter and has a quick folding mechanism which makes it highly portable.

**Pros:** 
- High max speed
- Lightweight and easy to fold
- Good value for money

**Cons:** 
- Shortest range
- Non-pneumatic tires

The E Prime III uses a thumb-activated paddle control system, making it easy to control, but its non-pneumatic tires could make rides less smooth compared to the other two models.

## Use Cases and Recommendations

**For long commutes:** Xiaomi Mi M365 offers the longest range and would be best suited for longer commutes. 

**For comfort and style:** If comfort and aesthetics are your top priorities, the Segway Ninebot ES2 with its shock absorption and LED lights would be your best bet.

**For speed and portability:** If you value speed and portability, the Razor E Prime III would be the most suitable choice.
